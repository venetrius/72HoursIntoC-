How much can I learn in 72 hours? From Java to .Net.

<entry>
I am a Java developer who as an answer to the market, going to learn .Net. 
What about the 72 hours? It is a great motivation to have a short strict deadline. And I also want to show off my skill to learn quickly. Not to 
memorize, but to be able to use new concepts.
What do I know right now? Not much, C# supposedly has a really similar syntax as Java. .Net is a huge collection of tools. I have Visual Studio Code in my laptop, and maybe a C# compiler as well. I will see it. What I do not know. What is the file extension for C#?
Time to learn. My first goal is 'Hello World' application and than a simple console application with input.
