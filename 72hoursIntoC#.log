How much can I learn in 72 hours? From Java to .Net.

I am a Java developer who as an answear of the market, goint to learn .Net. 
What about the 72 hours? It is a great motivation to have a short strickt deadline. And I also want to show off my skill to learn quickly. Not to 
memorize, but to be able to use new concepcts.
What do I know  right now? Not much, C# supposedly has a really similar  syntacx as Java. .Net is a huge collection of tools. I have Visual Studio
Code in my laptop, and maybr a C# compiler as well. I will see it. What I do not know. What is the file extension for C#?
Time to learn. My first goal is 'Hello World' application and than a simple console application with input.
